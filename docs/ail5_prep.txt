Dear {{fullname}},

Thank you for your submission to Agency and Intentions in Language 5 (AIL5). After a careful review by our scientific committee, I regret to inform you that your submission No. {{submission_number}} was not selected for presentation this year.

Please understand that a rejection is not a reflection of the inherent value of your work. We had to reject a number of excellent abstracts. The most common reasons for rejection were that there were abstracts that better fit the theme of the workshop or its interdisciplinary nature.
 
We encourage you to continue your valuable work and welcome your future submissions.

Sincerely,
Julie Goncharov (on behalf of the scientific committee)


Dear X.

Thank you so much for your abstract. Looking forward to your presentation at AIL5!

Cheers,
Julie
